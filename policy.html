            How we keep your information secure
        </h1>
        <p>
            We place great importance on the security of all information associated with our users. We use measures such as encryption, pseudonymisation, information access controls, and firewalls.
        </p>
        <p>
            Keep in mind that submission of information over the internet and mobile networks is never entirely secure. We cannot guarantee the security of information you submit via the Web App whilst it is in transit over the internet or mobile networks and any such submission is at your own risk.

            How long we keep your information 
        </h1>
        <p>
            By providing you with products or services, we create records that contain your information, such as customer account records, payment and activity records. We manage our records to help us to serve our users well and to comply with legal and regulatory requirements. Records help us demonstrate that we are meeting our responsibilities and are evidence of our business activities.
        </p>
        <p>
            How long we keep records depends on the type of record, the nature of the activity, product or service and the applicable legal or regulatory requirements. How long we retain your information may change based on business or legal and regulatory requirements. If you are a U Move Pass user, we keep most of your data as long as you're using Pass and for six years after that to comply with the law and if we face a legal challenge. In some circumstances, we may keep data longer if we need to (because it's in our legitimate interest and/or if the law requires).
        </p>
